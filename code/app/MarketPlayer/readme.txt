Open MarketPlayer.pro with Qt Creator. Build and start.

The program is a trading simulator where the actors will decide based on their amount of goods and strategies. 

You can setup the number of actors and amount of goods (resources), select how the actors will behave (e.g. offer acceptance strategy). Recommended: Random Triangle, Want higher gain.

Then press Apply. Press Start to see the simulation in action. You can overview the data on diagrams (Main and Trade Overview tabs). You can also pause the simulation and check each trade situation on the Edgeworth Box tab.

If a simulation is over (sooner or later the trades will decrease and stop), you can save a result on the Setup tab to History. Run some simulations with different behaviors and add their outputs to the History. Then change to Comparison mode and compare the results on the Overview tabs.
